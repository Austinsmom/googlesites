#'
#' Google Sites API from R
#'
#' The Google Sites Data API allows client applications to access and modify 
#' Google Site data using Google Data API feeds. Using the API, applications can 
#' create and modify the content of a Google Site, upload and download attachments, 
#' review the revision history across a Site, and display recent user activity. 
#' NOTE: A rebuilt version of Sites was launched on November 22, 2016. The Sites API 
#' cannot access or modify Sites made with this version, but can still access 
#' classic Sites.
#' 
#' The official documentation, provided by Google, is available at:
#' \url{https://developers.google.com/google-apps/sites/docs/1.0/developers_guide_protocol}
#' 
#' This package attempts to replicate functionality described in the protocol, 
#' but additional material can be found in the 
#' \href{https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/googlesites}{README} on GitHub
